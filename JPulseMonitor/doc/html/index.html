												<h1>Purpose</h1>
												<p>
													The project purpose is to develop an application to store and
													analyze workout data. Workout data in terms of duration of a
													training session, average pulse during the session and so forth.
													The focus will be on endurance training, means the application's
													main purpose is to handle information provided by a heart monitor.
												</p>
												<h1>Motive</h1>
												<p>
												 	In spring 2004 I bought a <a href="http://www.polar.ch">Polar Heart Monitor</a>.
												 	I planned to train some more (I am writing this lines in fall 2004 and I still run regularly)
												 	and wanted to hold constant. At first I simply used a spreadsheet, which actually did a
												 	quite good job. There is no downside about a spreadsheet everything is right there,
												 	one can draw nice charts and so on. Anyways I was up to learn some XML and I thought
												 	it would be good to have some real data to work with. That is how it started, a small DTD,
												 	a simple application to insert data, a GUI and so on and on.
												 </p>
												 <p>
												 	There are some free tools to monitor workout data. But I did not like any of these. Although
												 	to be honestly I did not look that hard and did not check any commercial solutions. I want
												 	a program that supports exactly the data my heart monitor is able to track, so coding my
												 	own application seemed the way to go ;-) 
												</p>
												<h1>Features</h1>
												<p>
													JPulseMonitor is a rather basic at the moment. It handles the kind of data my heart monitor
													provides, so it does the trick for me. But I would like to improve it and that is where *YOU*
													come in... Test it! Tell me your ideas! Does your heart monitor provide more information?
													What features are missing? How can a good evaluation be done, I am no sport scientist I
													need some help here...
													Please <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/sendmessage.php?touser=11035">contact me</a>.
												</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Manage one athlete (size, age...). No multiuser support yet.</li>
													<li>Manage training types, a training type represents a group of trainings. E.g. endurance training.</li>
    													<li>Manage trainings, a training is a entity you do on a regular base. E.g running for 45 minutes.</li>
													<li>Enter your workout data. Here you enter the measured data, like pulse, kcal, the date you trained and so on.</li>
    													<li>Some simple evaluation can be done. The workout data within a certain period can be displayed in a line chart.</li>
